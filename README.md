# Movie app

Through my journey of learning React this was my first application with a back end technologies , also applied but not extensively , below where the technologies used to achieve the idea :

- React and tailwind for front-end
- Appwrite for backend , to optimize the search functionality and update the trending movies on the app itself .
- Used TMDB API for fetching the movies , just in case you want to examine it for yourself , below is the link

  - TMDB link :
    ```bash
    https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs
    ```

As always you can use the app to showcase your skills , or if you want to use for other purposes . please you can go ahead and fork it .
